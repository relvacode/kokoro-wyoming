This project is a server that enables you to use [kokoro](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) together with your [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io).

[Kokoro](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) is a lightweight TTS (text to speech) model that punches way above its weight - being lightweight and producing very high quality human-like speech. 
[Wyoming](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/wyoming/) is a protocol that enables real-time TTS (and other solutions) for the Home Assistant ecosystem. 

I combine the two and wrap it in an easy-to-use Docker image that you can host wherever you please.

Here is the link for the docker image https://hub.docker.com/r/nordwestt/kokoro-wyoming (2.9k downloads at the time of writing this)
